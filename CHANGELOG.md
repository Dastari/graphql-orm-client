# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Compiler: validates documents against the schema; adds `__typename` and key fields; emits operation text, a sha256 hash, masked reader selections, inlined normalisation selections, per-type keys and versions, and `@live` flags.
- Store: one record per NodeId, with storage keys per argument set and keyless objects kept under their parent. An older record version never replaces a newer one. Reads give masked fragment references with structural sharing. Subscriptions notify only affected readers. Retention and garbage collection, and synchronous disposal.
- Client: `execute`, shared `watchQuery`, `preload`, `mutate` and `readFragment`. Request cancellation on disposal.
- React: `ClientProvider`, `useQuery`, `useFragment` and `useFragmentList`.
- Live layer:
  - The compiler emits one subscription per type with `@live` fragments, and picks `keys`, `key` or `unkeyed` mode from the schema.
  - `LiveManager` keeps subscriptions open for exactly the held records and writes events into the store.
  - DELETED removes the record and refetches the queries that showed it.
  - Status reports overflow. `client.refetchActive()` is available for use after a reconnect.
- Design, graphql-orm contract, roadmap, agent guidance and four bundled skills. No runtime
  code yet.
